# REPOSITORY CREATOR'S MINDSET
Always praying and coding.

This is what I think about coding:
1) Programming is the art of telling another human being what one wants the computer to do. ― Donald Ervin Knuth
2) No matter which field of work you want to go in, it is of great importance to learn at least one programming language. ― Ram Ray
3) If, at first, you do not succeed, call it version 1.0. ― Khayri R.R. Woulfe
4) Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. — Robert C. Martin
5) Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes. – Oscar Wilde

Coding has the future. To stand in the future, I need to learn coding. Coding can generate a whole new world of technologies. Coding can be a gateway of opportunities (which are provided by God. For this reason I will humble myself before him and give Him thanks first for it as it is written:
"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up." (James 4:10))

I will get opportunities and will grab them with the help of God. I will succeed in the future.
